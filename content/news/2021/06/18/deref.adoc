Welcome to the Clojure Deref! This is a periodic link/news roundup for the Clojure ecosystem. (https://twitter.com/ClojureDeref[@ClojureDeref] https://clojure.org/feed.xml[RSS])

## Highlights

* https://hopl4.sigplan.org/[HOPL IV] (History of Programming Languages) at https://conf.researchr.org/home/pldi-2021[PLDI 2021] is happening on Monday and Tuesday and includes a talk from Rich Hickey about the https://clojure.org/about/history[History of Clojure] paper. Registration is still available and the conference is online and features many other fine language developers!
* The results are out from the https://snyk.io/jvm-ecosystem-report-2021/[JVM Ecosystem Report 2021] and Clojure continues to make a strong showing as one of the most popular JVM languages (other than Java), rising from 2.9% last year to 8.4% this year. Lots of other interesting tidbits in there as well.

## Sponsorship Spotlight

Lately https://twitter.com/cgrand[Christophe Grand] and https://twitter.com/BaptisteDupuch[Baptiste Dupuch] have been https://twitter.com/cgrand/status/1404446965778292736[teasing] their work on a new ClojureDart runtime with Flutter support. You can support their work on GitHub: https://github.com/sponsors/cgrand[cgrand] https://github.com/sponsors/dupuchba[dupuchba]. https://github.com/nubank[Nubank] (users of both Clojure and Flutter) are now supporting both!

## Throwback Friday (I know, I'm doing it wrong)

In this recurring segment, we harken back to a talk from an older time to a favorite talk of yore. This week, we're featuring:

* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmCrMUhhg9c[Why is a Monad Like a Writing Desk?] by Carin Meier from Clojure/West 2012

In this lovely story from 2012, Carin Meier talks about monads through the lens of Clojure and Alice in Wonderland.
