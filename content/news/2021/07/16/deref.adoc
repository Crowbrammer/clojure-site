Welcome to the Clojure Deref! This is a weekly link/news roundup for the Clojure ecosystem. (https://twitter.com/ClojureDeref[@ClojureDeref] https://clojure.org/feed.xml[RSS])

## Highlights

Big congrats to https://amperity.com/[Amperity] on their https://amperity.com/blog/amped-up-announcing-amperitys-usd100m-series-d-financing[Series D financing] and valuation of $1B, making them another "unicorn" built substantially on Clojure and ClojureScript, approaching 100 Clojure developers. It is great to see these Clojure success stories at scale! Amperity has also been a great contributor to the Clojure ecosystem, so many thanks to them.

## Video throwback

If you haven't seen it, the classic https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlPaby7suOc[Every Clojure Talk Ever] by Alex Engelberg and Derek Slager does a pretty good job of lovingly capturing the foibles and curiosities of the Clojure community. Enjoy!
