Welcome to the Clojure Deref! This is a weekly link/news roundup for the Clojure ecosystem. (https://twitter.com/ClojureDeref[@ClojureDeref] https://clojure.org/feed.xml[RSS])

== Highlights

Peter Str√∂mberg spent the week working on a very cool zero-install https://calva.io/get-started-with-clojure/["learn Clojure"] story using Gitpod and Calva. He's looking for feedback - check it out, particularly if you are early in your Clojure journey!

In business news, Adam Renklint from Pitch https://pitch.com/blog/every-week[had a nice write up] about how they leverage Clojure as a tool for releasing every week. And congrats to Metabase for their https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/insight-partners-leads-30m-round-into-metabase-developing-enterprise-business-intelligence-tools/[$30M round] this week!  

== In the core

I mentioned last week that I was working on https://ask.clojure.org/index.php/2817/lighter-weight-aliasing-for-keywords[lightweight keyword aliases] and I've summarized what we've looked at, the final proposal, and patches at https://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/CLJ-2123[CLJ-2123]. I also spent some "quality" time this week updating all of the tools.deps dependencies. The latest Maven core release bumps some transitive deps with security reports and also fixes a number of concurrency issues we've been seeing through the Clojure CLI. Unfortunately, I also detected a regression in some of the Maven model building code and spent some time filing tickets and working with Maven folks on that (will probably lead to a new Maven release). For now I have worked around the regression so tools.deps/Clojure CLI users won't be impacted.

Fogus has continued work on new https://ask.clojure.org/index.php/1926/adding-functions-map-vals-and-map-keys[`update-keys` and `update-vals` functions] and a related https://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/CLJ-1879[older problem] that affects the benchmarking of those. He's also been doing some work on the Cognitect aws-api.

== Video Throwback

The Calva getting started work reminded me of Felienne Hermans' excellent Strange Loop 2019 keynote https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1ib43q3uXQ["How to teach programming (and other things)?"]. If you're interested in this area, also check out her upcoming book (available in large part in early release now) https://www.manning.com/books/the-programmers-brain[The Programmer's Brain] based on her research. It's a great read and I think every programmer will learn some interesting things from it.
