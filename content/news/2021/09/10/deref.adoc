Welcome to the Clojure Deref! This is a weekly link/news roundup for the Clojure ecosystem. (https://twitter.com/ClojureDeref[@ClojureDeref] https://clojure.org/feed.xml[RSS])

== Highlights

The Call for Papers is now open for https://www.reclojure.org/[re:Clojure], a virtual Clojure conference on Dec 3-4, and the inimitable Professor Sussman will be doing the keynote! Looking forward to attending!

https://exercism.org[Exercism] has a brand new https://exercism.org/tracks/clojure/concepts[Clojure course] (shoutout to Bobby Towers and everyone that contributed). They are interested in feedback, so give it a look!

== In the core

Fogus's work on update-keys, update-vals, and reduce-kv nondeterminism all went through a couple review cycles and is waiting for Rich, hopefully headed towards 1.11. He has also been looking at how the trailing map support added to Clojure 1.11.0-alpha1 affects specs using `keys*` and we're trying to decide on what needs to be done there.

I've been looking at a variety of things this week related to ease of use around static methods in the JDK and whether any contrib libs should be more readily available to Clojure users. The focus of this conversation has moved all over the place as we analyze various things and I'm not sure where it's all going yet!

== Art

First, I wanted to point to some more https://twitter.com/jackrusher/status/1187703042143150081[art from Jack Rusher], who makes heavy use of Clojure in the making. Follow for a stream of cool stuff.

And second I wanted to highlight the latest essay, https://tylerxhobbs.com/essays/2021/the-rise-of-long-form-generative-art["The Rise of Long-Form Generative Art"] by Tyler Hobbs. It is not about Clojure, but Tyler uses Clojure a lot and always has interesting thoughts in this area.
