Welcome to Clojure!

Check out <<learn/syntax#,Learn Clojure>>, <<xref/../../community/resources#,Resources>>, or <<xref/../../community/books#,Books>> for learning the language!

== Dependencies

Clojure requires Java. Clojure officially supports Java LTS releases (currently Java 8 and Java 11), but also tries to ensure interim versions work as well. You can use any Java installation, whether it's a commercial release from Oracle or an open source version based on OpenJDK (like adoptopenjdk).

The Clojure tools require that either the `java` command is on the path or that the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable is set.

== Clojure installer and CLI tools

Clojure provides <<deps_and_cli#,command line tools>> that can be used to start a Clojure repl, use Clojure and Java libraries, and start Clojure programs. See the https://github.com/clojure/brew-install/blob/1.10.1/CHANGELOG.md[changelog] for version information.

=== Installation on Mac via https://brew.sh[Homebrew]

Install the command line tools with `brew` from the clojure/tools tap:

[source,shell]
----
brew install clojure/tools/clojure
----

If you've already installed, you can upgrade to the latest release with:

[source,shell]
----
brew upgrade clojure/tools/clojure
----

Also see: https://github.com/clojure/homebrew-tools[Clojure's Homebrew tap] for more information.

=== Installation on Linux

Note: You can now use https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-on-Linux[Homebrew on Linux or Windows with WSL], similar to the Mac installation.

To install with the Linux script installer:

1. Ensure that the following dependencies are installed: bash, curl, rlwrap, and Java.
2. Use the linux-install script to download and run the install, which will create /usr/local/bin/clj, /usr/local/bin/clojure, and /usr/local/lib/clojure:

[source,shell]
----
curl -O https://download.clojure.org/install/linux-install-1.10.1.536.sh
chmod +x linux-install-1.10.1.536.sh
sudo ./linux-install-1.10.1.536.sh
----

=== Installation on Windows

An early release version of clj on Windows is available at https://github.com/clojure/tools.deps.alpha/wiki/clj-on-Windows[clj on Windows].
Please provide feedback at https://clojure.atlassian.net/projects/TDEPS.

== Other ways to run Clojure

*Local build*

Download and build Clojure from source (requires Git, Java, and Maven):

[source,shell]
----
git clone https://github.com/clojure/clojure.git
cd clojure
mvn -Plocal -Dmaven.test.skip=true package
----

Then start the REPL with the local jar:

[source,shell]
----
java -jar clojure.jar
----

*Try Clojure online*

https://repl.it/languages/clojure[repl.it] provides a browser-based Clojure repl for interactive exploration.

*Build tools*

Build tools provide a range of capabilities for building, running, and deploying Clojure libraries and applications. The two most popular Clojure build tools are https://leiningen.org/[Leiningen] and http://boot-clj.com/[Boot].
